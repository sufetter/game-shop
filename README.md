# game-shop-alpfa
A project to get familiar with React. The project was created during the summer practice between the 1st and 2nd courses, where it was necessary to create an application, game, website, etc. without being tied to the stack. Due to the fact that at that time I was interested in Frontend, I learned the basics of React and wrote a small project - an online game store.
